# Sales Prediction Analysis at KFC

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict daily sales at KFC using machine learning techniques. The analysis was conducted by Muzammil Mushtaq, a data science student and part-time worker at KFC.

## Data Collection and Analysis
Historical sales data from June to September 2023 and the initial 20 days of December 2023 were collected from the daily "Forecast" reports published by branch managers. The analysis included factors such as "Umsatz des Vorjahres" (sales from the previous year), "Wochentag" (day of the week), "Mittlere Temperatur" (average temperature), and "Woche des Monats" (week of the month) to generate their effects on Daily Sale.

## Model Development
Machine learning algorithms, including linear regression and Random Forest, were employed to train the model on historical sales data. The model aimed to predict future daily sales by considering weekly and monthly fluctuations. The model exhibited a 22% improvement over the current method used by KFC.

## Recommendations and Future Work
1. **Expand Dataset**: Include more historical sales data and incorporate additional relevant factors such as promotional activities and customer demographics.
2. **Advanced Techniques**: Implement advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods or deep learning architectures to improve model accuracy.
3. **Scaling**: Scale the predictive model to cover multiple KFC branches or other fast-food chains.
4. **Integration of Real-Time Data**: Explore the integration of real-time data sources and automated reporting systems for agile decision-making.
